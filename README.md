# Experimenter
This toolkit makes it possible to run thousands of experiments on
multiple remote clusters automatically. It has 3 parts, `submitter.py`,
`sweeper.py`, and `plotter.py`. The `submitter.py` allows you to submit
multiple jobs to multiple remote machines, so that you can run all these
 submitted jobs in parallel. Currently it only allows submitting jobs
 using slurm. The `sweeper.py` helps you to sweep over all parameter
 settings that defined in a json file. The `plotter.py` draws curves
 using the log data generated by your experiments.

The sweeper and plotter can be used in any machine. But submitter
currently is only compatible with slurm, so make sure you have access to
 at least one remote cluster which has slurm installed. For example, I
 have an account on compute canada, so I can use clusters including
 cedar, mp2, etc.

To test these 3 modules, run
`python test/test_sweeper.py`, `python test/test_plotter.py` and
`python test/test_submitter.py` (submitter needs to be configured first
with you own setting. test/test_submitter.py is an example)
.
